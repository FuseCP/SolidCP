NAME
       znew -   recompress .Z files to .gz files

SYNOPSIS
       znew [ -ftv9PK] [ name.Z ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Znew recompresses files from .Z (compress) format to .gz
       (gzip) format.  If you want to recompress a file already
       in  gzip format, rename the file to force a .Z extension
       then apply znew.

OPTIONS
       -f     Force recompression from .Z to .gz format even if
              a .gz file already exists.

       -t     Tests the new files before deleting originals.

       -v     Verbose.  Display  the name and percentage reduc-
              tion for each file compressed.

       -9     Use the slowest compression method (optimal  com-
              pression).

       -P     Use pipes for the conversion to reduce disk space
              usage.

       -K     Keep a .Z file when it is smaller  than  the  .gz
              file

BUGS
       Znew does not maintain the time stamp with the -P option
       if  cpmod(1) is not available and touch(1) does not sup-
       port the -r option.
