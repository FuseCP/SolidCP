NAME
       zcmp, zdiff - compare compressed files

SYNOPSIS
       zcmp [ cmp_options ] file1 [ file2 ]
       zdiff [ diff_options ] file1 [ file2 ]

DESCRIPTION
       Zcmp  and  zdiff  are used to invoke the cmp or the diff
       program on files compressed via gzip.  All options spec-
       ified  are  passed  directly  to cmp or diff.  If only 1
       file is specified, then the files compared are file1 and
       an  uncompressed  file1.gz.  If two files are specified,
       then they are uncompressed if necessary and fed  to  cmp
       or diff.  The exit status from cmp or diff is preserved.

SEE ALSO
       cmp(1), diff(1), zmore(1), zgrep(1), znew(1), zforce(1),
       gzip(1), gzexe(1)

BUGS
       Messages  from  the cmp or diff programs refer to tempo-
       rary filenames instead of those specified.
