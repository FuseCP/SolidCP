ZFORCE(1)                                                            ZFORCE(1)



NAME
       zforce - force a '.gz' extension on all gzip files

SYNOPSIS
       zforce [ name ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       zforce  forces a .gz extension on all gzip files so that
       gzip will not compress them twice.  This can  be  useful
       for  files  with  names truncated after a file transfer.
       On systems with a 14 char limitation on file names,  the
       original name is truncated to make room for the .gz suf-
       fix.  For  example,   12345678901234   is   renamed   to
       12345678901.gz.  A  file  name  such  as foo.tgz is left
       intact.
