ZGREP(1)                                                              ZGREP(1)



NAME
       zgrep  -  search possibly compressed files for a regular
       expression

SYNOPSIS
       zgrep [ grep_options ] [ -e ] pattern filename...

DESCRIPTION
       Zgrep invokes grep on compressed or gzipped files.   All
       options  specified  are  passed directly to grep.  If no
       file is specified, then the  standard  input  is  decom-
       pressed  if  necessary  and  fed to grep.  Otherwise the
       given files are uncompressed if  necessary  and  fed  to
       grep.

       If  the  GREP environment variable is set, zgrep uses it
       as the grep program to be invoked.
