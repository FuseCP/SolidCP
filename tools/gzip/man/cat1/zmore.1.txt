NAME
       zmore  -  file  perusal  filter  for crt viewing of com-
       pressed text

SYNOPSIS
       zmore [ name ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Zmore is a filter which allows examination of compressed
       or  plain  text files one screenful at a time on a soft-
       copy terminal.  zmore works  on  files  compressed  with
       compress,  pack or gzip, and also on uncompressed files.
       If a file does not exist, zmore looks for a file of  the
       same name with the addition of a .gz, .z or .Z suffix.

       Zmore  normally  pauses  after  each screenful, printing
       --More-- at the bottom of the screen.  If the user  then
       types a carriage return, one more line is displayed.  If
       the user hits a space, another screenful  is  displayed.
       Other possibilities are enumerated later.

       Zmore looks in the file /etc/termcap to determine termi-
       nal characteristics, and to determine the default window
       size.  On a terminal capable of displaying 24 lines, the
       default window size is 22 lines.  To use a  pager  other
       than the default more, set environment variable PAGER to
       the name of the desired program, such as less.

       Other sequences which may be typed  when  zmore  pauses,
       and  their  effects,  are  as  follows (i is an optional
       integer argument, defaulting to 1) :


       i<space>
              display i more lines, (or another screenful if no
              argument is given)


       ^D     display  11  more  lines (a ``scroll'').  If i is
              given, then the scroll size is set to i.


       d      same as ^D (control-D)


       iz     same as typing a space except that i, if present,
              becomes  the new window size.  Note that the win-
              dow size reverts back to the default at  the  end
              of the current file.


       is     skip i lines and print a screenful of lines


       if     skip i screenfuls and print a screenful of lines


       q or Q quit  reading the current file; go on to the next
              (if any)


       e or q When the  prompt  --More--(Next  file:  file)  is
              printed, this command causes zmore to exit.


       s      When  the  prompt  --More--(Next  file:  file) is
              printed, this command causes zmore  to  skip  the
              next file and continue.


       =      Display the current line number.


       i/expr search  for  the  i-th  occurrence of the regular
              expression expr.  If the pattern  is  not  found,
              zmore  goes on to the next file (if any).  Other-
              wise, a  screenful  is  displayed,  starting  two
              lines  before  the place where the expression was
              found.  The user's erase and kill characters  may
              be  used to edit the regular expression.  Erasing
              back past the first  column  cancels  the  search
              command.


       in     search  for the i-th occurrence of the last regu-
              lar expression entered.


       !command
              invoke a shell with command.  The  character  `!'
              in  "command" is replaced with the previous shell
              command.  The sequence "\!" is replaced by "!".


       :q or :Q
              quit reading the current file; go on to the  next
              (if any) (same as q or Q).


       .      (dot) repeat the previous command.

       The  commands  take  effect immediately, i.e., it is not
       necessary to type a carriage return.   Up  to  the  time
       when the command character itself is given, the user may
       hit the line kill  character  to  cancel  the  numerical
       argument  being  formed.   In addition, the user may hit
       the erase character to redisplay the --More-- message.

       At any time when output is being sent to  the  terminal,
       the  user  can  hit  the  quit key (normally control-\).
       Zmore will stop sending output,  and  will  display  the
       usual  --More--  prompt.  The user may then enter one of
       the above commands in the normal manner.  Unfortunately,
       some  output  is lost when this is done, due to the fact
       that any characters waiting  in  the  terminal's  output
       queue are flushed when the quit signal occurs.

       The  terminal  is  set to noecho mode by this program so
       that the output can be continuous.  What you  type  will
       thus  not  show on your terminal, except for the / and !
       commands.

       If the standard output is not  a  teletype,  then  zmore
       acts  just  like  zcat,  except that a header is printed
       before each file.
