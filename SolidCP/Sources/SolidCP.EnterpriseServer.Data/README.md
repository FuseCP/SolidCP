# SolidCP.EnterpriseServer.Data
This project contains the EntityFramework database layer of SolidCP.EnterpriseServer. It uses EntityFramework Core 8 when running in .NET 8 or EntityFramework 6 when running in .NET Framework.

# Programmer's Introduction Video
Here's a [programmer's introduction video of the SolidCP EntityFramework port](https://youtu.be/fRJz-iDz4_s).

# Database Support
This implementation supports the following database flavors:

- Microsoft SQL Server
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- SQLite

PostgreSQL support is implemented, but is limited to .NET 8, because the EntityFramework 6 PostgreSQL driver for .NET Framework is buggy and not maintained anymore. But PostgreSQL should work when running EnterpriseServer on .NET 8 using EntityFramework Core.
Probably one could also support Oracle, adding support for it should be rather trivial, but we have chosen not to support it at the moment.
Even we support SQLite, we do not recommend using SQLite on a production server.

# Folder Structure
The entity classes for the entities are contained in the Entities folder. The entity model Fluent API configuration classes are contained in the Configuration folder. Migrations are contained in the Migrations folder and in the subfolder
corresponding to the database flavor. The folder CodeTemplates contains the T4 templates used for database scaffolding.
The Extensions folder contains extension classes.

# Scaffolding of the Database
The folder CodeTemplates contains the T4 templates used by the "dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold" command to create the
entity, dbcontext and configuration classes from an existing SQL Server database. You can run the scaffolding of the database by executing Scaffold.bat. The connection string for scaffolding must be set in the
SolidCP.EnterpriseServer.Data.csproj in the ScaffoldConnectionString property. Be sure to run the scaffolding against a
fresh database, since it will also scaffold seed data.
You can also apply changes to the database model done through the old way with update_db.sql, in that you apply
update_db.sql to the database, and then scaffold the database. You will see all the changes to the model in the
Entities\Sources\.., Configuraton\Sources\.. and DbContextBase.Source.cs files. You can then use the diff viewer
to track all changes in those classes and can then apply the changes to the classes in the Entities and Configuration
folders and to DbContextBase.cs.
For portability accross different database flavors, you'll have to tweak the classes in the Entities\Sources folder a
bit. In particular, you'll have to comment out all manual assignmens of a database type by the
[Column(TypeName="...")]. If you want to assign a specific database type, you'll have to do it in the Configuration
classes through the Fluent API, and you need to distinguish the different database flavors, so for a
```
[Colum(TypeName="ntext")]
public string ExecutionLog { get; set; }
```
for example you would write in the Fluent API:
```
if (IsSqlServer) {
    Property(e => e.ExecutionLog).HasColumnType("ntext");
} else if (IsCore && (IsMySql || IsMariaDb || IsSqlite || IsPostgreSql)) {
    Property(e => e.ExecutionLog).HasColumnType("TEXT");
}
```
and comment out the Column attribute like so:
```
// [Colum(TypeName="ntext")]
public string ExecutionLog { get; set; }
```

In the above code, the `HasColumnType("TEXT")` command is only run when running on .NET 8, by using `if (IsCore && ...)` because some EntityFramework 6 drivers cannot handle custom column types, so `HasColumnType` is only called when using EF Core. As migrations are always handled by EF Core, the migration creates the correct column type also for EntityFramework 6.

# Migrations
Migrations are only managed with EF Core, not with EF 6. They are always executed with .NET 8 or with SQL scripts by the installer, not with .NET Framework.

To create a new migration, you can run MigrationAdd.bat, or if you just want a migration for the database flavor
you're developing with, copy the individual lines in AddMigration.bat to a command line shell.

When you create SolidCP release with deploy-release.bat, deploy-release.bat creates backups of the Model Snapshots
..DbContextModelSnapshot.cs files, so you can always create migrations based on the last SolidCP release. When
creating a SolidCP release, one can combine all new migrations into one by using the DbContext in the snapshot backup .cs file for the `dotnet ef migrations add` command or by reverting the Model Snapshot to that of the last release and creating a new migration. During development, when you have to change the database model often you might want to revert the last migration and then calculate a new migration with the MigrationRemove.bat script or the command `dotnet ef migrations remove`.

# Usage of SolidCP.EnterpriseServer.Data
SolidCP.EnterpriseServer.Data provides a class DbContext, that can be used as EF DbContext to access the database,
It has properties to access the DbSet's of the Entities, and the usual SaveChanges etc. commands. In order to
consume SoldiCP.EnterpriseServer.Data, you don't have to import the assemblies for EF Core 8 or EF 6, just use the
SolidCP.EnterpriseServer.Data.DbContext class. It will use either EF Core 8 or EF 6 for accessing the database
depending on wether you run on NET 8 or on NET Framework.

# Connection Strings
SolidCP.EnterpriseServer.Data uses an additional setting in the connection strings, `DbType`. You can set the
`DtType` token in the connection string to either `DbType=SqlServer`, `DbType=MySql`, `DbType=MariaDb`,
`DbType=Sqlite` or `DbType=PostgreSql`. You don't have to specify a providerName with your connection string as SolidCP will determine
the correct database type according to the `DbType` token in your connection string automatically. So for
example correct connection strings would be:

- SQL Server: `DbType=SqlServer;Server=(local);Database=SolidCP;uid=sa;pwd=Password12`
- MySQL: `DbType=MySql;server=localhost;port=3306;database=SolidCP;uid=root;password=Password12`
- MariaDB: `DbType=MariaDb;server=localhost;port=3306;database=SolidCP;uid=root;password=Password12`
- SQLite: `DbType=Sqlite;data source=App_Data\SolidCP.sqlite`
